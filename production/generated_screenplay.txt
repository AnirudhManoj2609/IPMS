                    ECHOES OF YESTERDAY                     
============================================================



INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

The coffee shop is bustling with activity, the aroma of freshly brewed coffee filling the air. Customers type away on their laptops or chat with friends, while the sound of espresso machines and gentle chatter provides a soothing background hum. MAYA, a 32-year-old journalist with a confident yet haunted look in her eyes, sits at a small table by the window, nursing a cup of coffee. She stares out the window, lost in thought, as people walk by outside.

RAVI, a 35-year-old software engineer with a warm and nostalgic smile, enters the coffee shop, scanning the room for a familiar face. His eyes land on MAYA, and his face lights up with excitement. He weaves through the crowded room, dodging a woman carrying a large purse and a man typing away on his laptop.

MAYA notices RAVI approaching and a mix of emotions crosses her face. She forces a smile, trying to composed herself.

                                  RAVI
                  (moving in for a warm hug)
                  Maya, it's been ages! You look amazing.

MAYA hugs RAVI back, holding on a beat longer than necessary.

                                  MAYA
                  (laughing, pulling back)
                  You're one to talk, Ravi. You look like you've been doing well for yourself.

RAVI takes a seat across from MAYA, noticing the laptop and newspapers scattered around her.

                                  RAVI
                  (glancing at the laptop)
                  Still chasing stories, I see.

MAYA nods, taking a sip of her coffee.

                                  MAYA
                  (leaning in, a hint of sadness in her voice)
                  Trying to, anyway. It's not as easy as it used to be.

RAVI's expression turns sympathetic as he reaches out, placing a hand on MAYA's arm.

                                  RAVI
                  (softly)
                  I'm sorry, Maya. I had no idea. What's been going on?

MAYA hesitates, unsure of how much to reveal. She glances around the coffee shop, taking in the bustling atmosphere, before focusing back on RAVI.

                                  MAYA
                  (hesitating, then leaning in closer)
                  It's just...the stories I used to tell, they don't seem to matter as much anymore. And the ones that do...they're harder to tell.

As they talk, the background extras continue to move around them, creating a sense of chaos and normalcy. A woman nearby types away on her laptop, while a couple in the corner shares a romantic moment. The coffee shop ambience provides a constant, soothing hum, a contrast to the emotional intensity of MAYA and RAVI's conversation.

RAVI listens intently, his eyes locked on MAYA's, as the sounds of the coffee shop fade into the background.

                                  RAVI
                  (encouragingly)
                  You'll find your voice again, Maya. You're one of the most talented journalists I know.

MAYA smiles weakly, appreciation in her eyes, as RAVI signals the barista for a coffee.

                                  MAYA
                  (smiling slightly)
                  Thanks, Ravi. Just talking to you makes me feel like I can breathe again.

The barista arrives with RAVI's coffee, and he takes a sip, savoring the flavor.

                                  RAVI
                  (smiling)
                  Anytime, Maya. That's what friends are for.

As they sit in comfortable silence, the coffee shop continues to bustle around them, a reminder that even in the midst of chaos, connections can be found.
